<h1>mChatServer</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong>mChatServer</strong> is the server part of the mChat chat system along with the client for the server. Both of these projects are something that I'm developing for a university course in paralell computing systems.

<h2>Functionality</h2>
The server has the following functionality:
<ul>
  <li><strong>The</strong> configuration of the server is read from a file that is called <strong>server.properties</strong>. The user can confgire the port at which the server will listen for requests</li> <br />
  <li><strong>The</strong> server uses the <strong>log4j</strong> logging utility for logging. This allows for tuning the amount of logging work done by specifying different settings in the <strong>log4j.properties</strong> file</li> <br />
  <li><strong>The server receives requests from users, handles them and afterwards writes responses</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The server can be used for only interconnecting users so as to allow for a p2p transfer.</strong></li>
</ul>
